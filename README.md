#### Introduction

The Task Manager Application is a robust and user-friendly tool designed to facilitate efficient task management and organization. Built using Express.js, this application provides a comprehensive set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling users to effectively manage their tasks. The application is designed with a RESTful architecture, ensuring scalability and ease of integration with other systems.

#### Features

1. **Task Management:**

   - **Create Task:** Users can create new tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority, status, assignee, creator, completion date, estimated time, and comments.
   - **Read Tasks:** Users can retrieve a list of all tasks or a specific task by ID, providing an overview and details of their tasks.
   - **Update Task:** Users can update the details of existing tasks, allowing for flexibility and changes in task requirements.
   - **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed, keeping the task list organized and relevant.

2. **Security:**
   - **JWT Authentication:** The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure the API endpoints. Only users with a valid token can access the API, ensuring data privacy and security.

#### Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Express.js - A fast and minimalistic web framework for Node.js, used for building the server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Database:** MongoDB - A NoSQL database used to store task information in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) - A secure method for transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for authenticating API requests.

#### Deployment

The application is designed for deployment on cloud platforms like Netlify, allowing for easy scalability and access. Environment variables are used to securely manage sensitive information such as database credentials and JWT secret keys.

#### Usage

1. **Local Development:**

   - Clone the repository.
   - Install dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Update the `.env` file to store environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connect URI, JWT secret).
   - Run the application locally using `node app.js`.

2. **Deployment to Netlify:**

- The Task Manager Application has been deployed to Netlify, making it easily accessible via the following base URL: [https://superb-chebakia-4ecd9d.netlify.app](https://superb-chebakia-4ecd9d.netlify.app). To access the API, a valid token is required for authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the application.

#### Important Notes:

- **Cold Start Behavior:** Netlify deployments may go to sleep if no requests are made for a period of time. As a result, the first request after a period of inactivity might return an error. Subsequent requests will function normally once the application is active again.
- **Using the Token:** Ensure that each request to the API includes a valid token in the `Authorization` header. The token must be in the format `Bearer <your_token>`.

#### Steps for Using the Application:

1. **Access the Base URL:**

   - Use the base URL [https://superb-chebakia-4ecd9d.netlify.app/api/tasks](https://superb-chebakia-4ecd9d.netlify.app/api/tasks) to access the deployed application.

2. **Include the Token in Requests:**

   - For each API request, include the token in the `Authorization` header. The header should look like this:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
     ```

3. **Handling Cold Starts:**
   - If you encounter an error on the first request due to the application being asleep, simply retry the request. The application will wake up, and subsequent requests will be processed correctly.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly interact with the Task Manager Application deployed on Netlify, leveraging its secure and efficient task management capabilities.

#### Conclusion

The Task Manager Application is a feature-rich tool that simplifies task management and enhances productivity. Its secure, RESTful API and scalable architecture make it an ideal solution for individual users and teams looking to streamline their task management processes.
